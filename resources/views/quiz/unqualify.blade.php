                <h5 class="py-1"> Unfortunately our program is not available in your area.  There are many different reasons for this but typically it’s because your local utility does not offer <span class="fw-bolder">“net metering.”</span></h5>
                <h5 class="py-1">Net metering allows residential customers who generate their own electricity from solar power, to sell the electricity they are not using back to the grid.  So, without net metering your utility will not credit back your energy bill for the excess electricity your solar system generates. </h5>
                <h5 class="py-1">It is essential you are able to receive credit for the electricity your system generates, otherwise, your electricity bill will not decrease and so we cannot offer you the value essential with the purchase of a solar system. </h5>
